            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version Control means there is one main repository for all of the project files. Which means instead of saving multiple files that you made changes on with different names, you can have one file that saves the changes you made. Version control helps when having a team because they can check the files other members have made, make changes, then check them back in. This helps a lot with file sharing issues most people encounter. A version control system is a system that automatically notes who changed files, when they were changed, what changed about the files, and allows files to merge together.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> There are lots of benefits of using a version control system. Some of these include that files cannot be overwritten and there is one main, common repository that holds all the latest files worked on. When working on a project, you are able to go back to an older version of a file if needed. For example, if you make a change and decide you like the older version better, you are able to go back before those changes were made. It helps especially when in a group where everyone has different parts they are working on because it allows for merging of files with ease. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is where the files and directories are saved to, allowing users to push and pull from the repository to view their change history and track those changes. There are two different repositories- the local and the remote. The remote repository is where team members are able to see what the other members are doing, it resides on a remote server and is where files are shared and changes are tracked. The local repository is what is on the local machine of the individual user. So, for example, say two people are working on the same project- both of them will work on it in their local repository while sharing their files to the remote repository and each user is able to push and pull from this to see what the other has changed or created.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a type of version control system that is a distributed version control system. Its free and open sourced to be used for any type of project. In Git, every user has a copy of the repository data that I mentioned above stored locally on their machine. Since everything is local, you can work offline and there is no single point of failure. Git prevents unintentional overwrites of a file on the shared or remote repository so processes run much faster. Gits main goals were to be quick, have a simple design, and have the ability to handle both large projects and small ones.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three basic steps to Github- add, commit, and push. These are the remote commands that push and pull from the local and remote repository to share files. For example, when you add items, it's like adding food to your shopping cart at the grocery store. They arenâ€™t yours yet because you haven't bought them, but you have intention of bringing them home with you. Next, is commit, which is like when you buy the items and you are checking out. The third step is push, such as when you bring the items home and they are now yours. </p>
